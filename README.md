I just recently came back to Boise State. I originally started back in '07(Dang! I feel old) and was a EE major, but that was not the road I was meant to take. I took some time off from school and now im a Computer Science major. I'm currently a Junior based on the classes that I have taken. I am working towards being able to graduate either Fall '21 or Spring '22.
